        A decadent Tiramisu
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup Warm Espresso</li>
        <li>40-45 Lady Fingers</li>
        <li>16 ounces Mascarpone Cheese</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons Rum</li>
        <li>4 Eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Granulated Sugar</li>
        <li>2 cups Heavy Whipping Cream</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon Vanilla Extract</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon Salt</li>
        <li>Cocoa Powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Set aside a 9x13 inch baking pan with 12-14 cup capacity</li>
        <li><strong>Dip half of the ladyfingers:</strong> You will
        form 2 layers each of dipped ladyfingers and mascarpone cream. 
        One at a time, quickly dip each side of the ladyfinger into the 
        espresso. Arrange the dipped ladyfingers in the baking pan to 
        make one solid layer.</li>
        <li><strong>Begin the mascarpone cream:</strong> With a 
        handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, 
        beat the mascarpone and rum together on medium speed in a large
        bowl for a few seconds, just to combine. Do not overmix. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the egg yolks:</strong> Place a heatproof bowl
        over a small pot of simmering water over medium-low heat. Don't 
        let the water touch the bottom of the bowl.  Using a whisk, whisk
        the egg yolks and 1/4 cup of granulated suger together until light 
        and foamy, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and immediately 
        pour into the mascarpone mixture. Beat on medium speed until combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Whip the heavy cream:</strong> Beat the heavy cream
        and vanilla extract together on medium-high speed until medium
        peaks form, about 3 minutes. Fold the whipped cream into the 
        mascarpone mixture.</li>
        <li><strong>Beat the egg whites:</strong> Beat the egg whites and
        salt together on medium-high speed until foamy, about 1 minute. 
        Increase to high speed and slowly pour in the remaining 1/4 cup
        of sugar. Beat until stiff peaks form, about 4-5 minutes. Fold into
        the mascarpone cream.</li>
        <li>Spread half of the mascarpone cream evenly over bottom layer
        of ladyfingers.</li>
        <li><strong>Dip remaining ladyfingers:</strong> Dip remaining 
        ladyfingers into remaining espresso mixture and arrange one-by-one
        on top of the mascarpone layer. Gently press each down so they are
        nice and compact. Using an offset spatula, spread remaining mascarpone
        mixture evenly on top. Refrigerate uncovered for 2-3 hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Add cocoa layer, then chill:</strong> After a couple hours 
        in the refrigerator, sift or strain a dense layer of cocoa powder all
        over the top. Cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, then refrigerate
        for at least 8-9 more hours and up to 1 day.</li>
    </ol>
